```

## 📈 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- Add more comprehensive integration tests
- Implement API rate limiting and authentication
- Add Swagger UI endpoint for interactive documentation
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Add monitoring and logging with structured logs
- Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data

## 🎯 Migration Success

The project successfully migrates from:
- ❌ Complex multi-database architecture
- ❌ Legacy dependencies (Informix, DynamoDB, ElasticSearch)
- ❌ DAL/gRPC complexity

To:
- ✅ Simple, single-database architecture
- ✅ Modern PostgreSQL + Prisma stack
- ✅ Direct API-to-database communication
- ✅ Maintainable TypeScript codebase

The migration preserves all business logic and API compatibility while dramatically simplifying the architecture and improving maintainability.
